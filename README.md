# What it is?
A simple HTML website. Feel free to fork it customize it and use it as your own.
 
 # Why I made this
I chose a random topic and made a webstie template for it. The goal was to train my design skills and explore the possibilities of SCSS.

# What I learned?
SCSS is nice, but in 2025, where framework are everywhere, it is quite irrelevant in my oppinion. I would much rather use Material UI and Next.js for my future projects.
