# What it is?
A simple HTML website. Feel free to fork it customize it and use it as your own.
 
 # Why I made this
I chose a random topic and made a webstie template for it. The goal was to train my design skills and explore the possibilities of SCSS.

# What I learned?
SCSS is nice, but in 2025, where framework are everywhere, it is quite irrelevant in my oppinion. I would much rather use Material UI and Next.js for my future projects.

# How to run it 
1. enter git clone in your folder
'git clone https://github.com/Nockiest/truhlarska-stranka.git'
2. connect the project to your git hub
3. Make all the necessary changes
4. Use Vercel or any other hosting platform to put your new website online
